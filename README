This is a Gauche port of the source code in Conrad Barski's "Land of Lisp".
The purpose is to let Gauche users play with the ideas in this fun book
and extend them.  I used Gauche-specific idioms rather freely, so it
won't run on other Scheme without tweaks.

Conrad told me that he put original code Public Domain.  I follow him,
so all the code here is Public Domain.

webserver.scm     (ch13) Simple web server (This isn't based on the book's
                         code.  I'd rather take advantage of Gauche libraries.)
